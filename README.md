### Notes

1. If you wish to call the API directly
1.1 Set the `API_URL` to the desired url
1.2 Run the dev server with `ng serve`

2. If you wish to proxy pass the /api URL you need to do the followings:
    2.1 Change the `API_URL` to `/api`
    2.2 Change the `target` from `proxy.conf.json`
    2.3 Run the dev server with `npm start`
* `API_URL` can be found in `src/app/app.config.ts`
